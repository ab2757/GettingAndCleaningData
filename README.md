# Getting and Cleaning Data Project Assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Here are the data for the project: 
[Input Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

We have created this repository with two markdown files Readme.md and Cookbook.md, one output text file  ab_tidy_data.txt and one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following :

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
